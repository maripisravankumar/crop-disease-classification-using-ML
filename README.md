# crop-disease-classification-using-ML
build a machine learning algorithm to correctly classify if a plant is healthy, has stem rust, or has leaf rust. Wheat rust is a devastating plant disease affecting many crops, reducing yields and affecting the livelihoods of farmers and decreasing food security 

**ABSTRACT:
Today major crops are suffering from various types of diseases. The diseases in crops are in the different parts like roots, leaves, and stem; but leaves are the most common part for detecting the diseases. Due to different sizes, shape, and colors of leaves, it is a major challenging task to identify and classify diseases. The researcherâ€™s main focus is to develop such a technique which can identify disease in minimum time and more accurate. Machine learning and Computer Vision technologies have a major contribution for developing such techniques in this domain.
